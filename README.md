# AmethystSongMod

Hello! This is a fun project I did. It allows you to use commands to make it so that Minecraft amethyst blocks create music instead of random notes. 

I am not the first one to think of this idea. I was inspired by this video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj86KEPsB78

Additionally, YouTuber Rishbob has made a Bukkit plugin version of this same idea. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIDAhu3_QfE&t=10s

My version is different in that it:

  -It can be used in singleplayer
  
  -I created a python application (https://github.com/keithk1210/AmethystSongMusicXMLConverter) that allows you to convert sheet music to a command that can be used with my mod. The tutorial is here. https://github.com/keithk1210/AmethystSongMod/wiki/The-%22Faster%22-way
