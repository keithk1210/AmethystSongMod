# AmethystSongMod

Hello! This is a fun project I did. It allows you to use commands to make it so that Minecraft amethyst blocks create music instead of random notes. 

I am not the first one to think of this idea. I was inspired by this video.

Additionally, YouTuber Rishbob has made a Bukkit plugin version of this same idea.

My version is different in that it:

  -It can be used in singleplayer
  -I created a python application that allows you to convert sheet music to a command that can be used with my mod. The tutorial is here.
